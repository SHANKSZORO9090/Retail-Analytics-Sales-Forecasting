# Retail Analytics & AI-Powered Sales Forecasting

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end retail analytics and sales forecasting workflow
using historical sales data from multiple stores and product categories.

The objective is to extract actionable business insights, segment store performance,
and forecast future revenue trends using machine learning and time-series models.

## Dataset
• Time period: January 2023 – December 2024  
• Records: ~73,000  
• Key features:
  - Date
  - Store ID
  - Product Category
  - Quantity Sold
  - Unit Price
  - Revenue  

Dataset provided as part of a Data Science internship at Unlox Academy.
The dataset is not publicly shareable.


## Tools & Technologies
• Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning, EDA, dashboards  
• Python – pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels  
• Machine Learning – K-Means clustering  
• Time Series – SARIMAX forecasting  


## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing in Excel  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and seasonality  
3. Store segmentation using K-Means clustering  
4. Revenue forecasting using SARIMAX time-series models  
5. Integration of results into Excel dashboards for insights

## Key Insights
• A small subset of stores contributes a major share of total revenue  
• Certain product categories consistently outperform others  
• Clear seasonal sales patterns are observed  
• Forecasts indicate stable short-term revenue growth
